### Welcome

Welcome to **A Game Named 'Simon'**!
This game was based on the classic color-sequence memory game from the late 70s, and this rendition of the game was developed by **Joachim Canete**, a student in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, Cohort *SEI: 1130*.

### About

**A Game Named 'Simon'** follows similar logic to its namesake, in which the game will require the player to memorize and replicate an ever-growing sequence of randomly selected colors. There is no end-game and no cap to how many levels a player can reach. However, upon failing to replicate the sequence generated by the computer, the game will initate a **game-over event** and the game will end. You can check out **A Game Named 'Simon'** through Joachim's [GitHug Page]()!

### Interaction

Upon loading up **A Game Named 'Simon'**, the player will click the **_Start_** button to begin playing. The first level begins with a sequence comprised of 1(one) randomly selected button, and every sequential level increments the sequence by 1(one), so the second level will have 2(two) buttons in its sequence, but retain the previous interation's selection.

> Red
> Red, Blue
> Red, Blue, Green
> Red, Ble, Green, Yellow
> Etc.,

Failing to replicated the sequence generated by the computer, the game will end and text will pop up below the buttons displaying the number of levels completed by the player.

[Game Over](AGNS_gameOver(smol))

In order to begin a new game, the player *must* click the **_Reset_** button, which will clear the game **game-over event**. The player may then click the **_Start_** to initate a new game.

### Development

Development of **A Game Named 'Simon'** began with the construction of a basic wire frame comrpised of 4(four) `button` elements nested within a `table` element. Above and below the `table` elemant were 2(two) `h1` elements, where the the *above* element hosted the title of the game, and the *below* element hosted the **game-over event**.

As development continued, it became apparent that buttons were not the most efficient direction to take in considertion of `CSS` styling for both looks and animations. The `button` elements were replaced with `div` elements to accomodate the aforementioned intent of styling, and later for efficient usage in writing of the game logic.
